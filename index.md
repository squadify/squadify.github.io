Project: Club Hub
Overview
The problem: UH Manoa has over 200 Registered Independent Organizations, plus many more that do not have this “official” status but are nonetheless active organizations. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn (a) what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.

The solution: The Club Hub application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.

Club Hub has three user roles, all of whom login with their UH ID. Regular users browse the directory. Admins make sure site content is appropriate and grant “club admin” privileges to selected users. Club Admins have the ability to edit the data associated with their club.

The site should not simply support browsing by a list of clubs in alphabetical order, but should also allow filtering by interest area. For example, “athletic” clubs, “art” clubs, “music” clubs, etc. A club can belong to multiple interest areas.

Users can specify interest areas, and be notified when a new club is created matching that interest area (or an existing club adds that interest area).

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, create new categories of musical tastes, capabilities, and goals, and ban inappropriate users who violate the Terms of Use.

For useful Meteor code examples, be sure to see the Meteor 4 module.

Note: if you choose this idea for your final project, you cannot name it “Club Hub”! Come up with a different name for your final project.

Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:

Public Landing page
Login page
User home page
Admin home page
Club admin home page.
Browse clubs by interest area(s).
Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for clubs of interest.
Club admin goes into site, updates their club profile.
Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

Notify admins when club data changes so they can review for appropriateness.
Provide “expiration date” for club listings (either one semester or one academic year). To retain a listing, the club admin or admin must login and click a “renew” button for the club to re-list it in the site.
Allow students to rate clubs.
