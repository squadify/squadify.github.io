<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p><em>The problem:</em> UH Manoa has over 200 <a href="http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php">Registered Independent Organizations</a>, plus many more that do not have this “official” status but are nonetheless active organizations.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn (a) what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.</p>

<p><em>The solution:</em> The Squadify application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.</p>

<p>Squadify has four user roles where three have to login with their UH ID. Regular users browse the directory without logging in. Students seeking to apply to a club can login, create a basic profile and apply to the club. Admins make sure site content is appropriate, allow club creation, and grant “club admin” privileges to selected users. Club Admins have the ability to edit the data associated with their club and receive an email when a person is applying to the club.</p>

<p>The site should not simply support browsing by a list of clubs in alphabetical order, but should also allow filtering by interest area. For example, “athletic” clubs, “art” clubs, “music” clubs, etc.  A club can belong to multiple interest areas.</p>

<p>Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, create new tags, and ban inappropriate users who violate the Terms of Use.</p>

<p>After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notify admins when club data changes so they can review for appropriateness.</li>
  <li>Provide “expiration date” for club listings (either one semester or one academic year).  To retain a listing, the club admin or admin must login and click a “renew” button for the club to re-list it in the site.</li>
  <li>Allow students to rate clubs.</li>
</ul>
